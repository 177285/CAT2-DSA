In arrays memory is allocated during compilation, while in linked lists memory is allocated during runtime.
In arrays, access time is constant (O(1)) for indexed elements because memory locations are contiguous and directly accessible while in linked lists access time is linear (O(n)) because traversal is required to reach a specific element.
In arrays insertion or deletion in the middle requires shifting elements, making it slower (O(n)) while in linked lists insertion or deletion at the beginning is fast (O(1)) since it only involves updating pointers.
