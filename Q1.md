Constants should be ignored- the coefficients and lower order terms are irrelevant for large input sizes.;O(2n)->O(n)
Focus on the dominant term- only the term with the highest growth rate matters.; O(n2+n)->O(n2)
Drop non dominant terms- for combined complexities, retain only the highest term; O(n+n2+logn)→O(n2)
Constant time operations- simple operations like accessing an array element are O(1)
Consecutive operations add- if operations run sequentially, add their complexities, then simplify; O(n)+O(n2)→O(n2).
